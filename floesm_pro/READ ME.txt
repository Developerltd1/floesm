I want there to be an option to upload all images at once and the website will be programmed 
to automatically create individual products for each without me having to do all of them 
individually. The .PNG files will all have the title of the image was formated like 
this "Acrylic N°0088_(11×14inch)_20200802" (Title_size_date) and it would automatically 
input that data into the product created on the website. 
For example Acrylic N°0088_(11×14inch)_20200802.png
